Star Gov by Seronis

Installation:
	Open latest release archive and drag its contents to your Star Ruler installations' mod folder. With the Steam distribution of the game on a Win7-64bit system this location is
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Star Ruler\Mods\
	Your systems location may vary but a hint that you are in the correct place is inside the /Mods folder you will see one or more folders prefixed with 'Legacy' and a folder named 'Tutorials'.


Description:
	StarGov is meant to be be a script based upgrade to the vanilla games' Governors. Its purpose is to provide a set of governors to cover different tasks more intelligently without completely making the Player obsolete. This is not meant to be a Player AI mod nor is it meant to change core features.
